# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
### This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following
* Gets the data required for the analysis
* Reads the data into R
* Merges the two data sets of interest
* Extracts the mean and standard deviations of each measurement
* Adds descriptive names to the activities
* Labels the rest of the data variables
* Creates a new, independent, tidy data set with averages
###The resulting tidy data set will be in tidydata.txt
